# Overview

This project gave me the chance to design and implement a functional hotel booking system using Kotlin, deepening my understanding of application structure, user input handling, and file-based data storage.

This hotel reservation app allows users to make, view, and cancel hotel bookings through a simple command-line interface. Users interact with menus to select check-in/check-out dates, choose room types, and review current reservations.

The purpose of creating this app was to enhance my skills in Kotlin while gaining hands-on experience with menu-driven programs, object-oriented programming, and working with the Kotlin standard library.

# Development Environment

* Kotlin as the primary programming language
* Visual Studio Code as the code editor
* Gradle for build automation
* Java for runtime compatibility and integration with Kotlin

*No external libraries were used—only core Kotlin and Java standard features.
